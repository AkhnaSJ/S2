# Python
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It’s widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Key Features of Python
- ***Readable and Maintainable Code*** :  Python’s syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, making it easier to write and maintain code.

- ***Extensive Standard Library***: Python comes with a rich standard library that supports many common programming tasks, such as file I/O, system calls, and even web browsers.

- ***Dynamic Typing***: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create one.
- ***Interpreted Language***: Python is an interpreted language, which means the code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.
- ***Cross-Platform***: Python runs on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# 1. Variables and Datatypes

### i. Text Type
**str** : Used for text (strings).

    text = "Hello, World!"

### ii. Numeric Types
**int** : Integer numbers.\
**float** : Floating-point numbers.\
**complex** : Complex numbers.

    integer = 42
    floating = 3.14
    complex_num = 1 + 2j

### iii. Sequence Types
**list** : Ordered collection of items.\
**tuple** : Ordered, immutable collection of items.\
**range** : Represents a sequence of numbers.

    list_example = [1, 2, 3]
    tuple_example = (1, 2, 3)
    range_example = range(5)

### iv. Mapping Type
**dict** : Key-value pairs.

    dict_example = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
### v. Set Types
**set** : Unordered collection of unique items.\
**frozenset** : Immutable version of a set.

    set_example = {1, 2, 3}
    frozenset_example = frozenset([1, 2, 3])

### vi. Boolean Type
**bool** : Represents True or False.

    boolean = True

### vii. Binary Types
**bytes** : Immutable sequence of bytes.\
**bytearray** : Mutable sequence of bytes.\
**memoryview** : Allows access to the internal data of an object that supports the buffer protocol.

    bytes_example = b"Hello"
    bytearray_example = bytearray(5)
    memoryview_example = memoryview(bytes(5))

### viii. None Type
**NoneType** : Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

    none_example = None
